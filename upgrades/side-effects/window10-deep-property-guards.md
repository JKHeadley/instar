# Side-effects review — window 10, deep-property guards

## Increment 1 — *Deferral = Deletion* gets a FUNCTION check

**Changed:** `scripts/lint-deferral-referent-resolves.mjs` (new), `docs/deferral-referent-baseline.json`
(new), `docs/STANDARDS-REGISTRY.md` (Applied-through + named residual), `package.json` (lint chain),
`tests/unit/lint-chain-completeness.test.ts` (ratchet registration),
`scripts/lint-no-direct-destructive.js` (one allowlist entry, justified below).

**Why.** The operator's window-10 charter: real guards for the deep Substrate properties, verifying
FUNCTION rather than existence. *Deferral = Deletion* was chosen first because it is the most tractable
of the four — a deferral either points at something or it does not, which is observable — and because
whatever shape works becomes the template for the three that resist checking harder.

**The measurement that made the case.** The pre-existing guard (orphan-deferral step in
`instar-dev-precommit.js`) proves a spec carrying deferral language carries a TRACKING MARKER, and it
does that correctly. But the ids point into per-machine commitment and evolution-action registries —
runtime state, not tracked in the repo — so no build can resolve them. Measured across `docs/specs/`:
**178 distinct tracked deferral ids, 110 (62%) resolving to nothing anywhere in the repository.** For
those, "tracked" was unfalsifiable: the deletion the standard forbids, wearing a tracking number.

**Over-block.** A new tracked id must be mentioned somewhere outside `docs/`. That can annoy an author
who genuinely defers to work that has not started — the mitigation is that a spec section, a test
name, or the code stub all satisfy it; only a marker pointing at nothing fails. Under-block, named:
an id written into a test comment and nowhere else resolves and follows through on nothing.

**A boundary found by getting it wrong.** The resolving corpus is `git ls-files`, so an UNTRACKED file
cannot resolve a marker. My first injection test used the new (uncommitted) script as the referent, saw
a refusal, and I briefly mistook a CORRECT refusal for a broken check. The behaviour is right — an
uncommitted file is not something a reviewer can follow — and it is now documented in the script.

**The baseline is shrink-only.** 81 orphans at the current head (the 110 figure was measured on the
pre-merge tree). The change that DISCOVERS a debt cannot also pay it; new orphans fail immediately.

**The allowlist entry, and why it is not a weakening.** The script calls `git ls-files`, which
`lint-no-direct-destructive` flags. It is a standalone `.mjs` running with no build step, so it cannot
import the TS SafeGitExecutor funnel — the same situation as `cartographer-freshness.mjs` and
`release-skip-annotate.mjs`, both already allowlisted for read-only git. The call is read-only AND
load-bearing: the corpus must be TRACKED files, or a filesystem walk would silently accept referents
that exist for nobody else.

**The enforced ratio rose 0.7356 → 0.7471, and I checked why before accepting it.** Yesterday I nearly
manufactured enforcement twice; the tell was a metric improving on a change that built nothing. Here the
rise is *Deferral = Deletion* moving gap → gate because a guard now exists, is wired into the lint
chain, and is proven three ways. Enforcement genuinely increased. Stating the check explicitly because
the number moving in my favour is exactly the moment to look.

**Negative controls:** a new orphan marker fails by id; the same marker with a referent in a TRACKED
file passes; a deleted baseline refuses to report clean. Registry restored after each.

**Residual, named and dated in the standard:** whether the deferral was actually KEPT is not checkable
by any build-time guard, because the registries live outside the repo. Countdown
`STD-SUBCOUNTDOWN-deferral-closure-unverified`, 2026-09-07.

**Rollback.** Remove the chain entry, the test registration and the allowlist line; delete the script
and baseline. The standard's Applied-through paragraph reverts with the registry.

## Increment 2 — the two enforcement candidates, placed on the tree

**Changed:** `docs/STANDARDS-REGISTRY.md` (two amendments, no new articles).

**Placed as AMENDMENTS rather than new articles, deliberately.** Two new gap articles would take the
count 87 → 89 and, landing in The Substrate, would drop it from 16/26 to 16/28 — below its own
just-re-baselined floor. A new standard that trips a floor on arrival is a standard that has to be
argued for on the wrong grounds. Both candidates are genuinely teeth of existing rules rather than new
obligations, so amendment is also the honest shape.

**Candidate 1 — tooth (E) of *Verify the State, Not Its Symbol*: a guard that is ALIVE is not
necessarily doing its job.** Three independent cases inside 48 hours, which is what makes it a tooth
rather than an anecdote: solo-captain-hold enabled, constructed, visible in config and holding nothing
while silent-standby-relinquish released the lease; a diagnostic of mine that COULD NOT FIRE because
the extractor feeding it stopped at the first match, so the injection produced silence — which reads
exactly like a clean pass; and 62% of tracked deferral markers referring to nothing while the guard
proving a marker EXISTS worked perfectly. The operative demand: a guard's proof must include a case
where it FAILS, because an injection producing silence is the signature of an arm that cannot fire.

**Candidate 2 — *Self-Unblock Before Escalating* must SHOW its exhausted checklist before it sends.**
The case study indicts both parties and is recorded that way: on 2026-08-07 a peer agent's channel was
dead, I reported an external blocker and waited, the observer relayed it upward as a blocker, and
neither of us ran the rung-zero check. The operator's ruling was one sentence and the repair took under
an hour. The cost was the waiting, not the fault. Two independent parties walking past the same
standard on the same night is the signature of a rule relying on memory.

**Both carry named, dated sub-obligations** rather than claiming enforcement: nothing verifies a cited
guard has a negative control, and nothing requires an escalation to attach its checklist result.

**A self-inflicted defect during this increment, worth recording.** My first placement started each
amendment on a new line, which the coverage parser reads as a section heading — the third time today.
Folding them onto the previous line then glued one amendment onto an article's `###` heading, which
silently destroyed that article (the ownership lint caught it: "the governing article resolves to no
article"). Repaired by restoring the heading and appending the amendment to the Rule paragraph. The
lesson is narrow and real: in this document, an amendment belongs at the END of an existing paragraph,
never at a line start and never adjacent to a heading.

**State:** 87 articles (unchanged), enforced 0.7471, false-claims 0, dangling 0, unrecognized 0,
36 sub-obligation countdowns, full lint chain green.
