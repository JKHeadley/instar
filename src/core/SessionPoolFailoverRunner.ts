/**
 * SessionPoolFailoverRunner — the in-agent PRODUCER of a real failover E2E result
 * for the Multi-Machine Session Pool rollout gate (§Rollout, Track H).
 *
 * The gate is a two-part machine:
 *   - `SessionPoolE2EResultStore` holds the signed Tier-3 E2E verdict per stage.
 *   - `StageAdvancer` promotes shadow→live-transfer ONLY on a green prior-stage
 *     E2E for the CURRENT commit, and auto-reverts on red.
 *   - `SessionPoolRolloutDriver` (the cadenced driver) turns a recorded green into
 *     an actual promotion toward an operator ceiling.
 *
 * What was missing (the track-H "real-hardware / test-as-self proof" follow-up):
 * the store is written by the vitest failover E2E in CI, but a DEPLOYED agent has
 * no green of its OWN — nothing inside a running agent proves that agent's actual
 * shipped code can fail a live conversation over to its standby and records that
 * proof. Without an in-agent green, the driver has nothing to promote, so a
 * deployed agent's sessionPool stays at `shadow` forever (the 2026-07-22 overnight
 * incident: a mentee agent sat at watch-only, so when its primary machine slept the
 * standby could not take over).
 *
 * This runner closes that gap. On each `tick()` it runs an injected failover CHECK
 * and, on a genuine pass, records a `green` for the proven stage into the E2E store
 * — the honest, self-earned proof the driver needs to promote the agent.
 *
 * ── Honesty line (load-bearing) ──
 * A `green` is recorded ONLY from a genuine `green` verdict returned by the check.
 *   - check → 'green'  ⇒ record green   (the agent proved its own failover)
 *   - check → 'red'    ⇒ record red     (a real regression — the driver auto-reverts)
 *   - check THROWS      ⇒ record NOTHING (an infra/availability error is NOT a
 *                        failover verdict; recording a fabricated green would wrongly
 *                        promote, recording a fabricated red would wrongly demote —
 *                        so a throw yields NO verdict and the stage is untouched).
 * A green feeds a promotion, so the runner NEVER manufactures one from silence.
 *
 * ── Dark by default (real authority) ──
 * A recorded green can promote the agent's sessionPool stage — real authority, same
 * class as the driver and the reactive swap. So the runner is a strict no-op unless
 * `enabled()` is true. The decision core is pure (the two-node failover CHECK is
 * injected) so it tests with zero sessions and zero network; the heavy in-process
 * two-node check is supplied by the caller in production (a follow-up increment) and
 * a deterministic fake in tests.
 *
 * ── v1 scope ──
 * The runner ORCHESTRATES (gate → run check → record verdict honestly). It does not
 * itself implement the two-node failover; that check is injected. This mirrors how
 * `SessionPoolRolloutDriver` takes an injected `StageAdvancer` rather than embedding
 * the stage machine.
