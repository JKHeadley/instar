# Standby-Write Reconciliation + Typed Refusal

## 0. One-paragraph summary

The mesh has two contradictory models running at once: the **one-awake** model
(the serving lease flips the WHOLE StateManager read-only on every non-holder —
one process-wide boolean) and the **active-active session pool** (per-topic CAS
custody deliberately places owned, serving sessions on "standby" machines). The
collision is F9's sharpest line: *the Laptop's StateManager was READ-ONLY
("standby") while actively OWNING pool topics*. Meanwhile the P2-6 family showed
mutating routes (`POST /evolution/actions`, `POST /attention`) hanging
open-endedly instead of refusing. This spec (roadmap 4.3) replaces the blanket
boolean with **ownership-scoped write admission** — every write is classified
into a write **domain** (machine-local / session-scoped / topic-scoped /
cluster-shared) and admitted by a synchronous in-memory check grounded on the
session-pool FSM's single-owner guarantee — and gives every inadmissible write
a **typed, machine-readable refusal in <2s**, never a hang.
It also closes the P2-6 root-cause file honestly: the hangs are NOT a blocking
lock in the write path (§1.4) — the admission layer makes refusal instant and
measurable, and the event-loop-starvation arm is instrumented here and tracked
as its own work item (P1-A7/P2-A8).

## 1. Problem — root-caused (grounded 2026-07-02, v1.3.722 tree + live probes)

### 1.1 The contradiction (F9): write authority is lease-shaped, ownership is topic-shaped

Write authority today is ONE process-wide boolean derived ONLY from the serving
lease:

- `MultiMachineCoordinator.reconcileRoleToLease` —
  `src/core/MultiMachineCoordinator.ts:1190`: `this.state.setReadOnly(!holds)`.
  Also set on startup (`:446`), demote (`:578`), promote (`:544`).
- `StateManager.guardWrite` — `src/core/StateManager.ts:135-139`: when
  `_readOnly`, EVERY guarded write throws
  `"StateManager is read-only (this machine is on standby). Blocked: <op>"`,
  with exactly one carve-out: `sessionScoped` writes when `_sessionPoolActive`
  (`src/core/StateManager.ts:123-139`, from standby-pool-session-writes.md) and
  the journal-prefix allowlist (`guardJournalWrite`, `:162-171`).

But pool custody is per-topic CAS: a non-lease-holder legitimately OWNS and
SERVES topics. Live evidence captured this session (Laptop stderr, 2026-07-02):

```
[SessionManager] Failed to record build context for "echo-interactive-…":
  StateManager is read-only (this machine is on standby). Blocked: set
```

`SessionBuildContextStore.record` (`src/core/SessionBuildContextStore.ts:52`;
the underlying kv write is `writeAll` → `state.set` at `:105`, key
`session-build-context`, `:6`) is a write about a session THIS machine owns
and is serving — blocked by the blanket boolean because it routes through the
kv `set` (a "shared" op by default). Every added machine is a standby-shaped
writer-that-can't-write (mm-current-state §D.5): the model cannot scale past
N=2 because N−1 machines are write-crippled for state they own.

### 1.2 There is no refusal layer — most mutating routes never consult ANY write gate

Neither route in the P2-6 family touches the read-only guard at all:

- `POST /evolution/actions` (`src/server/routes.ts:18012`) →
  `EvolutionManager.addAction` (`src/core/EvolutionManager.ts:1245`) →
  `loadActions`/`saveActions` (`:1167/:1174`) → `readFile`/`writeFile` on the
  `'action-queue'` name (`:1168/:1201`) — **plain synchronous fs to
  `state/evolution/action-queue.json`**, bypassing StateManager entirely.
  (Distinct store, do not conflate: `state/evolution/evolution-queue.json` is
  the PROPOSALS store — `loadEvolution`/`saveEvolution`, `:781/:788`, write at
  `:813` — and is not in this route's path at all. Round-1 finding S1 asserted
  the opposite and was mis-diagnosed; §8's I3/store-snapshot probes must
  assert against `action-queue.json`.)
- `POST /attention` (`src/server/routes.ts:12323`) →
  `TelegramAdapter.createAttentionItem` (`src/messaging/TelegramAdapter.ts:3798`)
  → `saveAttentionItems` (`:4244`) — **plain synchronous fs to the adapter's
  `state/attention-items.json`**, also bypassing StateManager.

So "standby is read-only" is enforced ONLY for StateManager-routed writes.
Everything else silently writes machine-local files on whichever machine the
request lands on. There is no typed refusal because there is nothing that could
refuse: no layer knows which machine a given write belongs to. The observed
"standby write model" is therefore not a strict model at all — it is a blanket
guard over one store, holes for everything else, and no admission decision
anywhere.

### 1.3 Why the routes HANG instead of erroring: the handler paths are bounded; the process is not

Root-cause-first finding: **every await in both P2-6 routes is bounded when the
event loop is live** —

- The outbound tone gate is raced against a hard budget:
  `reviewWithinBudget(...)` at `src/server/routes.ts:2038` with
  `OUTBOUND_GATE_REVIEW_BUDGET_MS = 20_000` (`src/server/middleware.ts:391`);
  every disposition (open/hold/degrade) produces a verdict.
- Every Telegram API call aborts at 15s (60s for the long-poll `getUpdates`):
  `TelegramAdapter.apiCall` (`src/messaging/TelegramAdapter.ts:5361-5364`,
  `AbortController` + `setTimeout(abort, timeoutMs)`).
- `EvolutionManager` I/O is synchronous (`readFile`/`writeFile`,
  `src/core/EvolutionManager.ts:750/761`) — it cannot park a request.
- A 30s request-timeout backstop exists for every route:
  `requestTimeout` wired at `src/server/AgentServer.ts:936`, timer-based 408 at
  `src/server/middleware.ts:503`.

A zero-byte, ≥90s hang with no 408 (the audit's exact observation) is only
possible when **timer callbacks do not run** — the 408 guard is itself a
`setTimeout`, so it starves together with the route. Live reproduction during
this spec's grounding (Laptop, 2026-07-02 ~14:42-14:46 PDT, pid 78257,
v1.3.722):

- `GET /health`, `GET /attention`, `GET /evolution/actions` ALL hung 8-35s with
  instant TCP connect (`time_connect` 0.0003s, zero response bytes) — the kernel
  accept queue accepts while no JS runs.
- `sample(1)` of the serving process: main thread inside `uv__run_timers` → JS →
  **synchronous `fs.readFileSync` / `readdir`** — sync fs I/O inside timer
  callbacks starving the loop, ~90s after a crash-loop restart
  (`[FATAL] Uncaught exception … Sent before connected.`).
- Same stderr window: `[DEGRADATION] MultiMachine.leaseTick: … stalled (no
  advance in >600000ms)` — a >10-minute dead window in the coordinator tick —
  plus repeated `SleepWakeDetector: Drift ~9-62s under load ratio 8-10 —
  treating as CPU starvation` (the P1-A7 signature).
- The server then died mid-probe (connection refused) — the crash loop
  (`server-crash-loop-sleepwake` memory item) means boot-storm windows recur.

This also explains the audit's differential without a second mechanism: under
an **intermittently** starved loop, a cheap synchronous GET completes within one
service window, while a POST that needs body parse + an LLM-gate round + two
Telegram API round-trips needs many service windows and blows any curl budget —
"GET answers, POST hangs". And a fresh-boot probe (the v1.3.720 addendum, where
GET **and** POST `/evolution/*` hung on BOTH machines) lands in the boot storm,
where everything hangs — as reproduced above with `/health` itself hanging.

### 1.4 Consequence for fb-99ab6347 (hypothesis revision)

fb-99ab6347-a44's working hypothesis was "handler blocks at store load/mount,
possibly the WS2.5 replicated-store init". This spec's grounding **refutes the
handler-level arm**: `listActions`/`addAction` are synchronous over plain fs
(§1.3) and cannot park a request; there is no store mount in the request path.
The evidence (zero bytes + no 408 + `/health` hanging in the same windows +
the `sample` stack) points at **process-level event-loop starvation windows**
(boot storms of sync fs in timers; the sleep/wake crash loop restarting into
those storms; P1-A7 stalls). The build phase of THIS spec must
confirm-or-falsify with the §6 event-loop instrumentation before fb-99ab6347 is
closed; the starvation root itself (making boot/timer work async, the crash-loop
fix) is P1-A7/P2-A8 scope, deliberately NOT this spec's (§2 Non-goals).

## 2. Goal / Non-goals

**Goal.** (a) *Ownership-scoped writes:* a machine that owns pool topics gets
writes for the state it owns — the blanket lease-boolean is replaced by a
write-domain model in which machine-local and owned-session/topic state is
writable everywhere it legitimately lives, and only genuinely cluster-shared
state stays lease-holder-only. (b) *Typed refusal:* a mutating route that is
genuinely inadmissible on this machine refuses in <2s with a machine-readable
reason — never a hang, never a bare 500, and a refusal mutates nothing.
(c) The U4 audit findings become registrable: `POST /evolution/actions` and
`POST /attention` succeed (or typed-refuse) in <2s on BOTH machines (§8
live-proof), unblocking attention item `agent:mm-audit-registration-debt-2026-07`.

**Non-goals.**
- NOT fixing the event-loop starvation root (sync-fs boot storms, the
  sleep/wake crash loop, P1-A7 stall-vs-sleep discrimination, P2-A8 exit
  logging). This spec *instruments* loop health (§6) so hang windows are
  measurable and attributable, and bounds what a live loop can do; it does not
  refactor boot.
- NOT write-forwarding/proxying to the owner (a refusal names the owner; the
  caller re-targets). Forward-on-refusal is the named Phase-2 follow-up
  <!-- tracked: write-forward-on-refusal -->
  `write-forward-on-refusal` (frontloaded decision §9.13) — deliberately out of
  wave 1 and wave 2.
- NOT relaxing any cluster-shared write on a non-holder. Fork-safety for
  lease/jobs/kv/events is never weaker than today (invariant I4).
- NOT changing WS2.x replication semantics — the domain model rides the
  existing per-machine-store + replication-emitter architecture unchanged.
- NOT a general request-timeout redesign.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 D1 — Write-domain taxonomy (the model that replaces the boolean)

Every mutating surface is classified into exactly one domain:

| Domain | Definition | Admission rule | Examples (initial classification) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `machine-local` | This machine's own single-writer store; cross-machine convergence is handled by the entry's **named convergence story** (see below — for a git-synced shared path the story must carry BOTH axes) | **Admit on every machine, always** — lease-irrelevant, pool-state-irrelevant | evolution stores (`state/evolution/*` — logical story: WS2.5 replication for `action-queue.json` ONLY, and only where `multiMachine.stateSync.evolutionActions` is enabled (the emitter is injected in `saveActions`, `EvolutionManager.ts:1212`; dark on the fleet, so the fleet's logical story today is honestly "none yet"); file-level arm: `git-sync-excluded` — a wave-1 build item, see below), attention items (`state/attention-items.json` — resolves to `<stateDir>/state/attention-items.json` on the primary bot (`botStateDir === stateDir`, `TelegramAdapter.ts:809/:816`); logical story: pool-scope GET merge + WS4.1 ack; file-level arm: `git-sync-excluded` — same wave-1 build item), learnings (WS2.2), knowledge (WS2.4), coherence-journal own streams (the existing `guardJournalWrite` allowlist folds in unchanged, **including its path jail** — the prefix check at `StateManager.ts:162-171` that throws on any path escaping the journal root even when NOT read-only survives the refactor verbatim), **`SessionBuildContextStore` under its per-machine re-key (§3.3 — convergence: per-machine key, single-writer per file)**. (`corrections` was listed in earlier drafts with NO story — a direct I9 violation; it is DROPPED from the initial classification and re-enters only via the wave-2 inventory with a real story.) |
| `session-scoped` | State keyed to ONE session, whose owning machine is determined by pool custody (via the session's topic binding — see keying note below) | The §3.2 decision table, `session-scoped` row: unbound / binding-miss / no-record / released ⇒ admit (today-equivalent); owned record ⇒ admit iff FSM owner = this machine | `saveSession`/`removeSession` (`StateManager.ts:203/:369` — today's `sessionScoped` carve-out generalizes into this rule) |
| `topic-scoped` | State keyed to ONE topic; owner = the pool custody record for `String(topicId)` | The §3.2 decision table, `topic-scoped` row: no-record / released ⇒ **legacy lease boolean** (byte-identical to today — I4 by construction) unless the registry entry declares an explicit absent-window convergence story; owned record ⇒ admit iff FSM owner = this machine | topic profiles, topic intent, per-topic resume UUIDs (full inventory is the wave-2 grounding artifact — §3.5, ladder gate §7) |
| `cluster-shared` | Genuinely shared cluster state; single-writer = lease holder | Admit iff this machine holds the serving lease — **byte-identical to today** | lease records, job schedule state (`saveJobState`), kv `set`/`delete` (default for unclassified keys), `appendEvent` |

**Keying honesty (one index, two key derivations).** Pool custody is keyed by
TOPIC id: the pool's `sessionKey` IS the stringified topic id
(`src/commands/server.ts:20203` — `sessionKey = String(topicId)`). So the two
scoped domains resolve against the SAME ownership index with different key
derivations: `topic-scoped` uses `String(topicId)` directly; `session-scoped`
first maps session → topic via the **in-memory topic-session binding**
(`TelegramAdapter.getTopicForSession`, `src/messaging/TelegramAdapter.ts:2294`,
backed by the persisted `topic-session-registry.json`, `:813` — the in-memory
map ONLY; the disk-fallback `resolveTopicForSessionFromDisk` (`:2317`) is
forbidden on the admission path, I2). Scope resolution is the CALLER's job
using data already in hand (e.g. `saveSession` holds the Session record with
its `tmuxSession`); `admitWrite` receives a resolved scope and never looks
anything up outside its in-memory index.

**Convergence-story requirement (structural, not advisory — TWO axes).** Every
`machine-local` registry entry MUST carry a named convergence story, one of:
`ws2x-replicated` | `pool-scope-read-merge` | `per-machine-path` (the file
path or kv key embeds the machine id — single writer per file by construction)
| `git-sync-excluded` (listed in `FileClassifier` sync exclusions,
`src/core/FileClassifier.ts:122-151`) | `ephemeral-rebuildable`. **Second
axis (the round-2 S1 lesson):** a LOGICAL story (`ws2x-replicated`,
`pool-scope-read-merge`) says nothing about the FILE — two machines rewriting
the same git-synced file still manufacture recurring merge conflicts no matter
how the logical state converges. So any machine-local entry whose store sits
on a git-synced shared path MUST ALSO name its file-level arm:
`per-machine-path` or `git-sync-excluded`. A shared-path store missing either
axis is **refused classification** and stays `cluster-shared` (I8/I9) — this
is the generalized M3-b lesson. (Honesty: the registry schema does not make
the fork *unrepresentable* — it makes a story-less classification refusable
and the two-axis requirement lint-checkable; the enforcement is the I9 schema
validation + Tier-1 test, §8.) **Concrete wave-1 build item:** add
`.instar/state/attention-items.json` and `.instar/state/evolution/` (plus any
other path classified machine-local on a shared git-synced location by the
wave-2 inventory) to `FileClassifier`'s sync exclusions — today
`.instar/state/` is NOT excluded (`FileClassifier.ts:122-151`), so both
wave-1 route families' stores ride git-sync. This exposure is PRE-EXISTING
(both routes already bypass StateManager and write locally on every machine
today, §1.2) — the build item closes it rather than merely not-regressing it.

Default posture is fail-closed toward today's behavior: a StateManager op or kv
key with NO classification is `cluster-shared` (exactly the current guard). A
ROUTE with no declaration gets no admission wiring (no behavior change) but is
flagged by the conformance lint (§3.5) so coverage ratchets instead of rotting.

### 3.2 D2 — `WriteAdmission`: one synchronous, in-memory decision point

A new `WriteAdmission` primitive (src/core/WriteAdmission.ts):

```ts
admitWrite(domain: WriteDomain, scope?: { topicId?: number; sessionId?: string })
  : { admit: true } | { admit: false; refusal: TypedWriteRefusal }
```

Hard properties (invariant I2):
- **Synchronous and in-memory only.** No fs, no network, no LLM, no await on
  the admission path. It reads (a) the lease view the coordinator already
  maintains in memory, (b) the **ownership index** (below), (c) the domain
  registry (§3.5). Answer time is microseconds — the <2s SLO is met by
  construction whenever the loop is alive.

**The ownership index (decided — was OQ1).** `admitWrite` does NOT call
`SessionOwnershipRegistry.read()`: the production substrate
(`LocalSessionOwnershipStore`) does a synchronous `existsSync`+`readFileSync`
on every cache miss (`loadOne`, `src/core/LocalSessionOwnershipStore.ts:61-79`)
and **does not cache negative results** — a keyless write would `existsSync`
on every admission, violating I2. Instead WriteAdmission owns an
`OwnershipIndex`, kept correct by construction:

1. **Boot warm:** ONE synchronous `store.all()` scan at construction
   (`LocalSessionOwnershipStore.all`, `:119-139` — the one-time directory scan
   behind the `scanned` flag, over `<stateDir>/ownership/local`,
   `src/commands/server.ts:17434-17437`), deliberately off the request path.
   After the warm the index holds the COMPLETE local record set, so a negative
   answer ("no record for this scope") comes from memory — no per-miss fs.
2. **Transition hook at the `SessionOwnershipStore` INTERFACE (round-2 S4):**
   `onCommit(record)` is ADDED to the **store contract** (the
   `SessionOwnershipStore` interface, `SessionOwnershipRegistry.ts:65-81`),
   NOT as a private detail of one substrate — each shipped substrate fires it
   at its own mutation point:
   `LocalSessionOwnershipStore` inside `persist()` (after `cache.set`,
   `LocalSessionOwnershipStore.ts:81-95`), and
   `InMemorySessionOwnershipStore` inside `casWrite()` at its `recs.set`
   (`SessionOwnershipRegistry.ts:53-57` — that substrate has NO `persist()`
   funnel, so a Local-only hook would leave the index
   warm-once-then-permanently-stale whenever the pool runs on InMemory).
   Today that combination is near-benign only emergently —
   `shouldActivateDurableOwnership` forces the durable store on any machine
   consuming replicated placements (`src/commands/server.ts:17426-17441`) —
   but that is another feature's activation logic, not a guarantee this spec
   may lean on. BOTH mutation paths funnel through the store's own commit
   point — `registry.cas()` → `store.casWrite`
   (`SessionOwnershipRegistry.ts:172`), AND `OwnershipApplier` materializing
   replicated journal placements via the SAME `store.casWrite`
   (`src/core/OwnershipApplier.ts:211`). There is no third writer; the index
   can never miss a transition the local store saw.
3. **Parity by construction:** the index mirrors the store's in-memory cache
   exactly (asserted by a Tier-1 parity test over arbitrary cas/applier
   sequences, run against **BOTH shipped substrates** — §8). Cross-machine
   staleness — the local store lagging true mesh custody until the next
   `OwnershipApplier` tick — is the accepted §5 TOCTOU residual, identical to
   the window message-routing already lives with.
4. **Ingest validation (round-2 L1):** the index validates every record AT
   INGEST — `ownerMachineId` must be a string and `status` one of the known
   FSM statuses — regardless of which store path surfaced it. This is
   necessary because the store's own validation is asymmetric: `loadOne`
   requires `ownerMachineId` to be a string
   (`LocalSessionOwnershipStore.ts:67`) but the warm-scan `all()` validates
   only `ownershipEpoch` + `sessionKey` (`:127`) and caches the weaker
   record. A record failing ingest validation is classified **malformed ⇒
   fail-closed** — the §3.2 decision table's malformed/unwarmed arm
   (`ownership-unresolved`), never a `not-owner` refusal with `owner: null`.
5. Until the boot warm completes, scoped-domain verdicts are
   `ownership-unresolved` (fail closed, `retryable:true`); the warm is
   synchronous at construction so the window is one boot instant. In
   practice this clause is DEFENSIVE-ONLY and unreachable for any caller:
   the warm runs synchronously INSIDE the constructor on a single-threaded
   runtime, and the one-way attach (§3.2 pre-construction window) happens
   after construction — so no `admitWrite` call can ever interleave with
   the scan, and this clause can never produce a refusal today (no
   availability regression relative to the carve-out). It exists for a
   future substrate whose warm might run later than construction.
   The `InMemorySessionOwnershipStore` (dev-gate-off substrate) is trivially
   covered for warm cost (its `all()` is already pure memory) and covered for
   transitions by the interface-level hook above.

**The scoped-domain admission decision table (decided — was M2 + M5; split by
domain in round 3 — was C1).** For `session-scoped` / `topic-scoped` writes,
**when the session pool is active** (`_sessionPoolActive`, set at
`src/commands/server.ts:19525`), resolve scope → topic key (§3.1 keying note),
look up the ownership index, and admit per ONE coherent table — the two
domains share the owner check but deliberately DIVERGE on the absent/released
arm, because their today-baselines diverge (that divergence is what keeps I4
true in both columns):

| Index state for the scope | `session-scoped` | `topic-scoped` |
|---|---|---|
| UNBOUND — session has no topic binding (locally-spawned job / headless / lifeline sessions — never pooled), or the in-memory binding map misses | **ADMIT** (machine-local-by-construction) | n/a — a topic-scoped write carries its topic id; there is no binding step to miss |
| No record, or record `status:'released'` | **ADMIT** — today-equivalent: the current `sessionScoped && _sessionPoolActive` carve-out (`StateManager.ts:135-139`) already admits EVERY session write on a pool-active standby, so admit-on-absent/released only ever *tightens* relative to today | **LEGACY LEASE BOOLEAN** — admit iff NOT `_readOnly`, else refuse `read-only-standby`. Byte-identical to today (every topic-keyed kv write routes through `guardWrite` and is refused on every non-lease-holder), so I4 holds **by construction**. EXCEPTION: a registry entry may opt into admit-on-absent ONLY by declaring an explicit absent-window convergence story (I9-audited, both axes) — the default is the legacy boolean |
| Record in `placing` / `active` / `transferring` | **ADMIT iff `record.ownerMachineId === thisMachineId`**, else refuse `not-owner` naming the owner — identical rule, both domains | same |
| Index not yet warm, or record malformed (failed §3.2 ingest validation) | `ownership-unresolved` (fail closed, `retryable:true`) — reserved for genuine ambiguity ONLY | same |

Why the absent/released arms differ (the I4 reconciliation, stated once):
`session-scoped`'s admit-on-absent arm is the round-1 M2 reachability case —
its today-baseline ADMITS (the carve-out), so admitting cannot create a fork
that today's behavior doesn't already permit. `topic-scoped`'s today-baseline
REFUSES on every non-holder (the blanket boolean) — an admit-on-absent arm
there would put two writers on one shared per-topic path during pool
cold-start or background sweeps over stale bindings on two machines: exactly
the dual-writer fork I4(a)/(b) and §2 Non-goals promise cannot happen. The
round-2 draft applied one uniform arm to both domains and contradicted I4;
this table is the resolution, not a patch-over.

Unbound-arm rationale (unchanged from round 2): per-session files are keyed
by per-spawn session ids (no cross-machine fork surface), and refusing on a
binding miss would gate serving an inbound message on a standby — the exact
"Agent Is Always Reachable" regression this rule exists to prevent.

Released-arm grounding correction (round-2 S3): the round-2 draft justified
released⇒admit via "eviction-consistency: `releasedEvictionMs` deletes
released records after 24h" — **that mechanism does not run.**
`releasedEvictionMs` appears exactly once in src/ — the deps declaration
(`SessionOwnershipRegistry.ts:91`); no sweep consumes it,
`LocalSessionOwnershipStore` has no delete/unlink path at all, and released
records currently persist indefinitely. It is a **known dead knob — do not
re-cite it as an active mechanism.** Neither arm needs it: `session-scoped`
released⇒admit stands on today-equivalence alone (the carve-out admits it
today), and `topic-scoped` released⇒legacy-boolean needs no eviction argument
at all (released and absent produce the same verdict by the table, so a
future eviction implementation changes nothing).

Owner-check grounding (unchanged): the FSM names exactly ONE machine in every
non-released state — `ownerOf` returns `ownerMachineId` for all three
(`SessionOwnershipRegistry.ts:133-138`); `placing` names the placed owner,
`transferring` names the draining source until the target's claim lands
(`placementTargetOf`, `:144-150`, distinguishes the target; the
output-exclusion contract in `SessionOwnership.ts` already governs who acts
during a transfer). Consequence for the known F1 `placing`-wedge topics: the
placed owner KEEPS its writes (ownerOf names it) — this spec has **no
dependency on the F1 fix** and never turns a wedged placement into a
permanent owner-write refusal. There is no `contested` state in the FSM
(custody is a committed CAS record); the round-1 draft's
"placing/contested → refuse" is retired.

**When the session pool is INACTIVE** (pool dark, or
`multiMachine.writeAdmission` live on a pool-dark install — was S5): scoped
domains **collapse to the legacy lease boolean** — admit iff NOT `_readOnly`,
refuse `read-only-standby` otherwise. That is byte-identical to today's
behavior (scoped writes blocked on a pure one-awake standby, admitted on the
holder); the machine-local-by-construction argument deliberately does NOT
apply when the pool that would justify it is off. `machine-local` admits
everywhere regardless of pool state (that is its definition — and matches the
route reality of §1.2, where those stores already write locally on standbys).

- **Fail-closed on ambiguity** (I5, narrowed as above): a genuinely-empty
  ownership index on a single-machine agent admits (no peers ⇒ nothing to
  fork — I6).
- Consumed at BOTH seams:
  1. **Route seam:** mutating routes call it FIRST (§3.4).
  2. **Store seam:** `StateManager.guardWrite` delegates to it (§3.3) so
     non-HTTP writers (SessionManager, schedulers) get the same verdicts.
- **Pre-construction window (round-2 L2, explicit):** StateManager exists and
  takes writes long before the pool block that constructs WriteAdmission runs
  (`src/commands/server.ts:17415+`). During that window `guardWrite` runs the
  **legacy blanket verdict** — exactly today's behavior, I8's fail-toward-
  today direction. Attachment (`StateManager.attachWriteAdmission(...)` or
  equivalent) is **one-way** (never detached at runtime) and happens **before
  routes are wired**, so no HTTP mutating route can ever observe a
  half-attached state; only boot-time internal writers ride the legacy
  verdict, which is what they get today anyway.

### 3.3 D3 — StateManager re-scope: the boolean becomes one domain's input

`guardWrite(operation, opts)` gains a resolved domain (from the registry, by op
name + optional key) and delegates:

- `machine-local` → pass (even when `_readOnly`).
- `session-scoped` / `topic-scoped` → the §3.2 decision table (the existing
  `sessionScoped && _sessionPoolActive` carve-out generalizes into the
  session-scoped column; the topic-scoped column's absent/released arm stays
  the legacy boolean; see I4-b for the exact tightening/loosening honesty,
  per domain).
- `cluster-shared` → pass iff NOT `_readOnly` (byte-identical to today).

`setReadOnly` keeps its name and callers (`MultiMachineCoordinator` unchanged at
`:446/:544/:578/:1190`) but its semantics narrow to "the cluster-shared domain
gate" (plus the scoped-domain fallback when the pool is inactive, §3.2).

**kv classification is EXACT-KEY (decided — was OQ4/M3).** No prefix matching
in wave 1: a registry kv entry names one exact key (post-`validateKey` charset,
`StateManager.ts:174-178`). A key whose contents mix domains is **refused
classification** until the store is split or re-keyed — the first instance is
the store below.

**First kv entry: `SessionBuildContextStore` re-keyed per machine (decided —
was M3/M3-b).** The store today is ONE shared kv entry `session-build-context`
(`src/core/SessionBuildContextStore.ts:6`) → ONE file
`state/session-build-context.json` (`state.set` writes
`state/<key>.json`, `StateManager.ts:498-506`) holding a map keyed by tmux
session name. That path is git-synced: `.instar/state/` is NOT in
`FileClassifier`'s sync exclusions (`src/core/FileClassifier.ts:122-151`) and
`GitSyncManager` auto-commit+push is constructed for both roles on git-backed
mesh machines (`src/commands/server.ts:4548`). Admitting that write on every
pool machine would have two machines rewriting the SAME file continuously —
recurring merge conflicts routed to the LLM conflict resolver. So wave 1
**re-keys the store per machine**: `session-build-context-<machineId>` (the
machine id charset-jailed to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` before embedding, mirroring the
`sessionFileName` jail in `LocalSessionOwnershipStore.ts:35-39`, so
`validateKey` always passes). **Machine-id source + null fallback (round-2
L3):** the id comes from the **coordinator/mesh identity**
(`MultiMachineCoordinator.identity.machineId` — the same identity the
scheduler is handed, `src/commands/server.ts:6228`), NOT from
`StateManager._machineId` (`setMachineId`, `StateManager.ts:93`, has no
production caller in src/ — a dead seam a builder must not improvise
against). When no mesh identity exists (single-machine installs may have
none), the embedded id is the literal **`local`** — safe: no peers ⇒ no
second writer ⇒ no fork; the builder does not invent
`session-build-context-null`. Each machine reads and writes ONLY its own key —
single writer per file, git-sync carries peers' copies inertly. Domain:
`machine-local`, convergence story `per-machine-path`. Build-context restore is
inherently machine-local (the recorded worktree path is on this disk), so
reads never need peers' keys. The legacy `session-build-context` key is left
inert (entries carry a 6h max age, `:7`, so it self-drains) and removed by a
one-time cleanup on the lease holder during the build — never migrated.

A refused store-seam write throws a `WriteRefusedError` carrying the
`TypedWriteRefusal` — callers that today catch-and-log the string keep working
(the message is preserved), and route handlers map it to the §3.4 wire shape.

### 3.4 D4 — Typed-refusal contract (the U4.3 contract, applied to writes)

A refusal is TYPED: distinguishable from success, from a crash, and from
garbage (u4-3 §G4 canary lesson: an untyped 2xx means nothing). Wire shape:

```json
HTTP 409
Retry-After: 5
{
  "error": "write-refused",
  "code": "not-owner" | "lease-required" | "ownership-unresolved" | "read-only-standby" | "admission-error",
  "domain": "topic-scoped",
  "scope": { "topicId": 30193 },
  "thisMachine": { "machineId": "…", "nickname": "the laptop" },
  "owner": { "machineId": "…", "nickname": "the mini" } | null,
  "leaseHolder": "…" | null,
  "asOf": "2026-07-02T21:40:00Z",
  "retryable": true,
  "hint": "This write belongs to 'the mini' — re-send it there. (Advisory only: moving the topic is a consent-gated operator decision, not a step to auto-follow.)"
}
```

Contract clauses:
- **409 for ALL admission refusals, uniformly — including the transient
  `ownership-unresolved` (decided — was OQ5).** 503 is REJECTED for the
  transient case: 503 is the house feature-dark signature on every route, and
  a transient refusal must never be confusable with "feature dark". Instead,
  every `retryable:true` refusal carries a **`Retry-After` header (seconds)**
  so generic HTTP clients back off correctly. (400 stays validation, 408 the
  existing budget backstop.)
- **Caller-retry brakes (P19):** internal callers that catch
  `WriteRefusedError` MUST NOT busy-retry — they ride their existing
  schedules/backoffs (the refusal is re-evaluated on the next natural pass).
  The §6 aggregate alert is the loop tripwire: a caller looping on 409s
  surfaces as ONE deduped item naming the route.
- `owner`/`leaseHolder` come from LOCAL knowledge only, staleness-tagged via
  `asOf` — the refusal itself never makes a mesh call (I7).
- **The `hint` is advisory prose for a HUMAN reader, never an instruction.**
  It must not name a runnable command: moving a topic is consent-gated
  (`POST /pool/transfer` answers 409 `needsConfirmation` for live autonomous
  runs), and an agent auto-following a refusal hint into a transfer would
  bypass that consent shape.
- **Refuse-before-touch** (I3): admission runs BEFORE any store write, any
  Telegram send, any gate call — a refused `POST /attention` has created no
  topic, persisted no item, spent no LLM tokens. A refusal stays a refusal.
- **Bounded-before-expensive** (I1): on mutating routes the admission check is
  the FIRST await-free statement after body validation. **The check runs first
  in EVERY mode, including dryRun (decided — was OQ6):** the check is
  microseconds and side-effect-free, so ordering it first is behavior-neutral
  while dry (the verdict is log-only and the route proceeds into today's exact
  flow, tone gate included); there is no separate "reorder at live" event. The
  only flow that thins out at `dryRun:false` is the refusal path itself —
  refused sends produce no gate decision-log rows, which is precisely I3's
  intent. No caller depends on gate-before-validation side effects (verified
  in the wave-1 route audit).
- The refusal is logged (§6) and NEVER auto-escalated per-event (no attention
  item per refusal — the 2026-05-22 flood lesson; a persistent refusal pattern
  surfaces as ONE deduped aggregate, §6).

### 3.5 D5 — Domain registry + route-seam wiring + conformance ratchet

- A central `WriteDomainRegistry` (data, not scattered constants): StateManager
  op names, exact kv keys, and HTTP route prefixes → domain + scope extractor
  + (for `machine-local`) the named convergence story (§3.1). Single source of
  truth; tests assert against the SAME map the server wires (the PR-#334
  dead-code lesson).
- **Route wiring, wave 1 (this spec):** the P2-6 family — `POST/PATCH
  /evolution/*` (`machine-local`, WS2.5-replicated), `POST/PATCH /attention*`
  (`machine-local`, pool-scope-merge + WS4.1), plus the store-seam
  classifications in §3.1's table. Both wave-1 route families are
  `machine-local` ⇒ **admit everywhere** — the user-visible fix for P2-6 is
  that these writes are admitted (and now instrumented), while the refusal
  machinery is proven by the store seam + tests, ready for wave 2.
- **Wave-2 inventory (decided — was OQ2):** the complete write-surface
  inventory is a **build Phase-1 artifact of THIS spec**, not a question left
  open for later: a grounding pass enumerates every mutating route in routes.ts,
  every StateManager op, and every kv key into the registry — each either
  classified (with convergence story where machine-local) or explicitly
  `TODO-classify` (which keeps today's exact behavior and is lint-counted).
  Wave 2 then activates the topic-scoped entries. **Ladder gate (external
  finding #2):** `dryRun:false` is REFUSED until the inventory is complete and
  reviewed — zero mutating surfaces absent from the registry (TODO-classify
  rows are permitted; absent rows are not). §7 carries the gate.
- **Conformance ratchet:** a lint sweep (the standards-enforcement pattern)
  flags any `router.post|patch|delete` in routes.ts with neither a registry
  entry nor an explicit `@write-domain:none` annotation (read-only actions,
  pure-compute triggers). Baseline recorded at build time; the count may only
  go DOWN (no new undeclared mutating routes).
- **Guard-manifest entry (a named build deliverable — was S4):**
  `writeAdmission` is added to the STATIC `GUARD_MANIFEST`
  (`src/monitoring/guardManifest.ts`): `key: 'writeAdmission'`,
  `kind: 'config'`, `configPath: 'multiMachine.writeAdmission.enabled'`,
  `dryRunConfigPath: 'multiMachine.writeAdmission.dryRun'`, `process:
  'server'`, `loadBearing: false` while the legacy blanket guard remains the
  enforcing layer (re-reviewed — and expected flipped — at fleet graduation,
  when the legacy guard's authority is subsumed). The posture row (`GET
  /guards`, `on-dry-run` while soaking) therefore cannot be forgotten: the
  lint that pairs the manifest with boot-constructed components enforces it.

### 3.6 D6 — What does NOT change

- WS2.x replication emitters, tombstones, fingerprints: untouched (the domain
  model is exactly why machine-local writes are safe — replication already owns
  convergence).
- The lease, its fencing, `pollFollowsLease`, U4.2/U4.4: untouched. This spec
  neither moves the lease nor changes who serves.
- The tone gate on `POST /attention`: unchanged semantics; the admission check
  precedes it in every mode (§3.4), but while dry the gate runs exactly as
  today.
- The `guardJournalWrite` path jail (`StateManager.ts:162-171`): survives the
  fold-in verbatim (§3.1) — a path escaping the journal prefix still throws
  even when not read-only.
- Single-machine agents: strict no-op (every domain admits; no refusal is ever
  emitted; the only observable delta is the §6 surfaces existing).

## 4. Invariants

- **I1 Bounded-before-expensive:** no mutating route performs unbounded or
  expensive work (LLM, network, large I/O) before admission has answered.
- **I2 Admission is sync + in-memory:** `admitWrite` never does fs/network/LLM
  on the admission path; p99 < 1ms under test. (The ownership index's ONE
  boot-warm scan happens at construction, off the request path — §3.2.)
- **I3 Refusal mutates nothing:** a refused write leaves zero durable trace
  besides its log row — no partial topic creation, no store write, no send.
- **I4 Fork-safety never weakens:**
  (a) `cluster-shared` on a non-holder refuses in EVERY mode — including
  dryRun, where the LEGACY blanket guard keeps enforcing while the new layer
  only logs would-verdicts;
  (b) each scoped domain is compared against ITS OWN today-baseline (the
  round-3 C1 reconciliation): **session-scoped** — today's pool-active
  blanket admits every session write on a standby; the new rule keeps
  admitting unbound / no-record / released scopes
  (machine-local-by-construction — the M2 reachability guarantee) and refuses
  ONLY a scope whose custody record positively names ANOTHER machine (the
  double-run/fork case) — a strict tightening. **topic-scoped** — today's
  baseline refuses every topic-keyed kv write on every non-holder (the
  blanket boolean); the new rule's absent/released arm IS that legacy
  boolean (byte-identical by the §3.2 table), and an owned record admits
  only the FSM's single named owner — never looser than today, in any arm.
  A machine serving an inbound message for a topic passes by construction —
  the router only routes to the custody owner;
  (c) relaxations (machine-local, owned-scope, and any I9-audited
  absent-window opt-in on a topic-scoped entry) activate only at
  `dryRun:false`.
- **I5 Fail-closed on genuine ambiguity ONLY:** `ownership-unresolved` is
  reserved for an unwarmed index or a malformed record (one failing the §3.2
  ingest validation). A missing custody record or missing session→topic
  binding is NOT ambiguity: for `session-scoped` it is the
  machine-local-by-construction case and ADMITS (§3.2; fail toward delivery,
  "The Agent Is Always Reachable"); for `topic-scoped` it resolves
  deterministically to the legacy lease boolean (§3.2 table — a definite
  admit-or-refuse, not an unresolved state). There is no `contested` FSM
  state.
- **I6 Single-machine no-op:** no peers ⇒ admit everything; behavior
  byte-identical except observability.
- **I7 Refusals are local-knowledge:** naming the owner/lease-holder uses only
  in-memory state, staleness-tagged — a refusal can never hang on a mesh call.
- **I8 Registry-or-legacy, never neither:** an unclassified StateManager op
  defaults to `cluster-shared` (today's exact guard); an unwired route keeps
  today's exact behavior and is lint-visible. No surface silently loses its
  guard by omission.
- **I9 No machine-local without a convergence story — on BOTH axes:** every
  `machine-local` registry entry names its logical convergence story, AND any
  entry whose store sits on a git-synced shared path also names its
  file-level arm (`per-machine-path` | `git-sync-excluded`) (§3.1); a
  shared-path store missing either axis is refused the classification and
  stays `cluster-shared`. A topic-scoped entry's absent-window opt-in (§3.2
  table exception) is audited under the same schema. Enforced by the registry
  schema + a Tier-1 test, not by review vigilance.

## 5. Failure modes & fail directions

| Failure | Direction | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership index diverges from the local store | Impossible by construction for local state: the index is warmed by the store's own scan and updated at each substrate's own commit point (the interface-level `onCommit`, §3.2 — both `registry.cas()` and `OwnershipApplier` funnel through `store.casWrite`); a Tier-1 parity test (both substrates) guards the invariant | §3.2 |
| Local custody lags TRUE mesh custody (cross-machine propagation delay) | Accepted, bounded residual: same TOCTOU window message-routing already lives with; custody can move between admit and the store write (ms-to-tick window). Convergence: per-machine single-writer files + journal replication (`OwnershipApplier` tick) reconcile; a write admitted under just-moved custody lands in a per-machine store whose merge semantics already handle it | §3.2 clause 3; L2 disposition §11 |
| Session→topic binding unresolved (in-memory map miss) | Fail toward DELIVERY: treated as unbound ⇒ admit (per-spawn session ids give no cross-machine fork surface; refusing would gate serving an inbound — the M2 regression) | §3.2 table, session-scoped unbound arm |
| Topic-scoped write with NO custody record (pool cold-start; background sweeps over stale bindings on two machines) | Fail toward TODAY: the legacy lease boolean — admit on the holder, typed-refuse `read-only-standby` on a standby. Never two writers on one shared per-topic path (the C1 fork) | §3.2 table, topic-scoped absent arm |
| Write arrives BEFORE WriteAdmission is constructed (boot window) | Fail toward TODAY: `guardWrite` runs the legacy blanket verdict until the one-way attach, which lands before routes are wired — no HTTP route can observe the window | §3.2 pre-construction window |
| Admission layer itself throws — store seam | Fail toward TODAY: legacy blanket guard verdict (exactly the current behavior) | try/catch around `admitWrite` at the seam |
| Admission layer itself throws — route seam | Per-domain split (external finding #6): `machine-local` routes PROCEED (fail toward delivery — refusing would create a NEW outage for writes that are safe everywhere); `session-/topic-scoped` and `cluster-shared` routes refuse typed `admission-error` (fail closed — a broken guard must not enable a fork). Both directions log | §3.4 code union |
| Event loop starved (P1-A7 window) | Honest: nothing in-process can answer; the §6 loop-lag gauge records the window so a hang is ATTRIBUTABLE (starvation) instead of misfiled as an admission failure | `monitorEventLoopDelay` gauge + probe co-measurement (§8) |
| Mixed-version pair (F4 class): one machine admission-live, peer on the old blanket | Safe by construction — admission is machine-LOCAL, no wire protocol; the old peer keeps throwing its raw string errors. NAMED here per the F4 lesson (any dev-gated mesh feature halves on a mixed pair): the §6 surface reports `mode` so the pair's asymmetry is visible, and graduation (§7) requires both dev machines flipped together | no cross-machine dependency in the design |
| Refusal storm (a caller loops on 409) | Bounded: refusals are cheap (no side effects) + `Retry-After` steers generic clients + the no-busy-retry contract binds internal callers (§3.4) + per-source aggregate alerting is the tripwire; the log row carries the caller route for diagnosis | §6 dedup |
| Pool dark while writeAdmission live | Scoped domains collapse to the legacy lease boolean (refuse `read-only-standby` on a standby, admit on the holder) — byte-identical to today; machine-local still admits everywhere | §3.2 pool-inactive clause |
| Crash mid-write after admit | Unchanged from today (atomic tmp+rename writes in both stores); admission adds no new partial-write states | §3.4 refuse-before-touch |

## 6. Observability

- **`GET /write-admission`** (Bearer): `{ enabled, dryRun, mode:
  "legacy"|"dry-run"|"live", domains: [{ domain, admitted, refused,
  wouldRefuse, wouldAdmitChanged }], recentRefusals: [ring buffer ≤50, typed
  bodies minus hints], ownershipIndex: { entries, lastCasTransitionAt },
  eventLoop: { p50, p99, max, starvedWindows24h } }`. 503 when dark (house
  rule).
- **`logs/write-admission.jsonl`** — one row per refusal AND per would-verdict
  divergence in dryRun (`ts, seam: "route"|"store", op/route, domain, scope,
  verdict, code, owner, leaseHolder`) — bounded + rotated. The dryRun rows are
  the graduation evidence (§7): `wouldRefuse` on a write that today SUCCEEDS =
  a false positive to fix before `dryRun:false`; `wouldAdmit` on a write that
  today THROWS read-only = the fix landing.
- **Event-loop-lag gauge** (`perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay`, ~zero cost) —
  exported on `/write-admission` and on the **AUTHED extension of `/health`
  ONLY** (the same posture as `multiMachine.syncStatus.ropeHealth`): the
  unauthenticated basic `/health` body never carries it. p50/p99/max/starved-
  windows is a live load oracle — handing it to an unauthenticated caller
  would be an outsider's timing instrument. This is the P2-6 attribution
  instrument (§1.3/§1.4) and the standing measurement P1-A7 needs anyway.
- **Guard posture:** `writeAdmission` appears in `GET /guards` via the §3.5
  `GUARD_MANIFEST` entry (dark-default classification; `on-dry-run` while
  soaking; `loadBearing:false` while the legacy guard enforces) — a load-shed
  disable is visible, never silent.
- **Aggregate alert only:** ≥N refusals of the same (route, code) within a
  window raises ONE deduped attention item; never per-event (flood lesson).
- **Admission-layer-throw occurrences join the SAME aggregate (round-2 L4,
  external r2 #2):** BOTH the fail-open machine-local proceeds AND the
  fail-closed `admission-error` refusals (§5 route-seam split) are evidence
  of a broken guard — each gets a named (route, code=`admission-error`,
  direction) aggregate row on `GET /write-admission` and rides the same
  ≥N-in-window ONE-deduped-attention-item discipline. A broken guard is never
  a log-only event, and never a flood.

## 7. Config, rollout ladder, migration

```jsonc
// .instar/config.json
"multiMachine": {
  "writeAdmission": {
    // OMITTED by default → resolveDevAgentGate: LIVE on a development agent,
    // DARK on the fleet (house Maturation Path).
    "enabled": undefined,
    "dryRun": true,        // dry-run FIRST even on dev (FD-7 telemetry pattern)
    "refusalAggregateThreshold": 5
  }
}
```

**DryRun cost semantics (explicit — external finding #7):** dryRun changes
NOTHING in execution or spend — every route and store write runs today's
exact flow (legacy guard enforcing, tone gate running, tokens spent exactly as
now); the admission verdict is computed and LOGGED only (the write-safety
canary pattern from credential-repointing). The only cost of dryRun is the
microsecond check + a log row.

Ladder (mutation-bearing → full ladder):
1. **Dark fleet / live-dev in dryRun** (ships this way): admission EVALUATES
   everything and LOGS would-verdicts; the legacy blanket guard keeps
   enforcing; zero behavior change anywhere. Soak on the dev pair (Laptop +
   Mini) collecting §6 divergence rows.
2. **`dryRun:false` on the dev pair — BOTH machines in the same deploy window**
   (the F4 mixed-pair lesson). **Gates, ALL required:**
   (a) the §3.5 write-surface inventory is COMPLETE and reviewed — every
   mutating route/op/key present in the registry (TODO-classify rows
   permitted; absent rows refuse the flip);
   (b) ≥3 days with zero `wouldRefuse`-was-wrong rows (legitimate write
   refused);
   (c) zero admitted-write fork incidents (WS2.x conflict surfaces stay
   clean);
   (d) the §8 live-proof green.
3. **Fleet default-on** in a regular release, `enabled:true` +
   `dryRun:false` defaults via `migrateConfig()` (existence-checked), after the
   dev soak; single-machine agents are unaffected at every stage (I6).

Migration parity: config default via `migrateConfig()`; no hook/skill/template
changes in wave 1 (the two wave-1 route families ADMIT everywhere — no caller
sees a new status); CLAUDE.md template gains the `GET /write-admission` +
"why did my write get a 409 naming another machine?" proactive trigger
(Agent Awareness standard); route callers that must learn 409 handling arrive
only with wave-2 classifications, each of which rides its own PR + template
note. Old-version PEERS need nothing (no wire change). `WriteRefusedError`
preserves the legacy message string for log-scraping continuity. The
`session-build-context` per-machine re-key ships inside wave 1 (§3.3) with its
one-time lease-holder cleanup of the legacy key.

**Close the Loop — named follow-ups get durable trackers at approval (round-2
<!-- tracked: topic-29836/close-the-loop-registrations -->
L5).** A named-but-untracked follow-up is the constitution's definition of
<!-- tracked: topic-29836/close-the-loop-registrations -->
abandoned. When this spec is approved, each of these is registered as an
evolution action (or commitment) in the same session, and the approval is not
complete until the registrations exist:
1. `write-forward-on-refusal` (§9.13 — the Phase-2 follow-up with its own
   ceremony); <!-- tracked: write-forward-on-refusal -->
2. the P1-A7 starvation-window escalation + the §8 live-proof re-run after
   any P1-A7 fix (retiring the excluded windows);
3. the `FileClassifier` sync-exclusion build item (§3.1) — it ships inside
   wave 1, but the tracker guards the case where wave 1 lands piecemeal;
4. re-classification of `corrections` (dropped from the initial table, §3.1)
   via the wave-2 inventory, with a real two-axis story.

## 8. Tests (tiers declared) + live-proof clause

- **Tier 1 (unit):** WriteAdmission verdict table (every domain × role ×
  ownership state × pool-active × dryRun — both sides of every boundary),
  specifically including: unbound session on a pool-active standby → admit;
  bound session whose topic is owned by ANOTHER machine → `not-owner` refusal
  naming it; `placing`/`transferring` records → the FSM owner admits, others
  refuse; **absent/`released` records split by domain (the C1 table):
  `session-scoped` → admit; `topic-scoped` → legacy verdict (holder admits,
  standby refuses `read-only-standby`), and admit ONLY on an entry declaring
  an I9-audited absent-window story**; pool-dark → legacy verdicts
  byte-identical (scoped refuse `read-only-standby` on standby); pre-attach
  boot window → legacy blanket verdict. Ownership index: parity with the
  store across arbitrary `cas()`/`OwnershipApplier` commit sequences, **run
  against BOTH shipped substrates (`LocalSessionOwnershipStore` AND
  `InMemorySessionOwnershipStore` — the interface-level `onCommit`
  contract)**; ingest validation (a record missing a string `ownerMachineId`
  or carrying an unknown status — e.g. one surfaced by the weakly-validated
  `all()` scan — classifies malformed ⇒ `ownership-unresolved`, never
  `not-owner` with `owner: null`); ZERO fs on the admission path (fs spied)
  including negative lookups; boot-warm completeness. Registry: exact-key kv matching
  (`session-build-context-<machineId>` → machine-local; the LEGACY
  `session-build-context` key stays cluster-shared); I9 refusal of a
  machine-local entry with no convergence story AND of a shared-git-synced-
  path entry with a logical story but no file-level arm (the two-axis rule). StateManager guardWrite
  delegation incl. legacy fallback on admission throw; journal path jail
  survives the fold-in (escape still throws when not read-only); refusal body
  schema incl. `Retry-After` on every `retryable:true`; route-seam throw
  split (machine-local proceeds / scoped+cluster-shared refuse
  `admission-error`); I2 timing (p99 <1ms over 10k calls); registry↔wiring
  identity (the map the tests read IS the map the server wires).
- **Tier 2 (integration):** `POST /evolution/actions` + `POST /attention` on a
  simulated standby-that-owns-topics → 201 (admitted, machine-local) with the
  gate still applied after admission; a `cluster-shared` route on a non-holder
  → 409 typed body + `Retry-After`, <2s, zero store mutation (I3 asserted by
  store snapshot); dryRun mode → legacy behavior + would-verdict rows +
  byte-identical spend path; admission-throw → the §5 per-seam fail
  directions.
- **Tier 3 (e2e lifecycle):** production init path constructs the registry,
  index, and routes; `GET /write-admission` answers 200 live-on-dev / 503 dark;
  guard posture row present. Burst-invariant: a refusal storm creates ≤1
  attention item.
- **Live-proof clause (the roadmap 4.3 acceptance):** on BOTH machines (Mini =
  lease holder, Laptop = pool-owning non-holder), a probe battery of
  `POST /evolution/actions` + `POST /attention` (plus one deliberately
  inadmissible cluster-shared write) — every probe **succeeds or
  typed-refuses in <2s**, measured p100 over ≥20 probes spread across ≥1h,
  with the event-loop-lag gauge co-recorded. **Attribution refinement
  (external finding #5) so a P1-A7 dependency cannot block acceptance
  indefinitely:** probes landing OUTSIDE attributable starvation windows must
  ALL pass — that is the acceptance bar for THIS feature. A probe landing
  INSIDE a starvation window (visible gauge spike co-timed with the slow
  probe) is attributed + escalated to P1-A7 with the gauge data and excluded
  from this clause; a slow probe with NO gauge spike is a REAL failure of this
  feature, full stop. The clause re-runs after any P1-A7 fix to retire the
  excluded windows.
- **Acceptance follow-through (Close the Loop):** immediately after the
  live-proof goes green on the dev pair, register the mm-audit P0/P1 findings
  ledger into the evolution queue via `POST /evolution/actions` on the Laptop
  (the machine that failed twice), resolve attention item
  `agent:mm-audit-registration-debt-2026-07`, and update fb-99ab6347 with the
  §1.4 revision + evidence.

## 9. Frontloaded decisions (complete — includes every round-1 open question)

1. **409 (not 503/423) for ALL admission refusals, including transient ones**
   — state-based conflict; 503 stays the feature-dark signature; every
   `retryable:true` refusal carries `Retry-After` so generic clients back off
   (resolves OQ5; external finding #3 contested-then-cleared).
2. **Refuse, don't proxy (wave 1 AND wave 2)** — forwarding a write is
   authority-bearing and duplicates WS4.1-style machinery; the refusal names
   the owner so the caller re-targets deliberately.
3. **Evolution + attention are `machine-local`** — both stores are per-machine
   single-writer with named convergence stories (WS2.5 replication; pool-scope
   merge + WS4.1). Admitting them everywhere IS the P2-6 fix, not a fork risk.
4. **The lease boolean survives as the cluster-shared gate** — no coordinator
   rewiring; smallest possible authority change; U4.2/U4.4 interplay untouched.
5. **Registry defaults fail toward today** (I8) — unclassified = current
   behavior + lint visibility, so partial adoption can't silently drop a guard.
6. **DryRun keeps the LEGACY guard enforcing** — the new layer gets zero
   authority until an explicit `dryRun:false`; dryRun changes nothing in
   execution or spend (§7).
7. **Event-loop instrumentation is IN scope; event-loop repair is OUT** — the
   typed-refusal guarantee is honest only if hang windows are measurable; the
   repair is P1-A7's own root-cause track. The gauge is authed-only (§6).
8. **Both dev machines flip `dryRun:false` in one window** — the F4 mixed-pair
   lesson applied prospectively.
9. **Ownership index = boot-warm + interface-level commit hook, never
   `registry.read()` on the admission path** (resolves OQ1/M1; refined by
   round-2 S4) — one synchronous `all()` scan at construction, then
   `onCommit` on the `SessionOwnershipStore` CONTRACT, fired by each shipped
   substrate at its own mutation point (Local: `persist()`; InMemory:
   `casWrite()`), covering BOTH mutation paths (`registry.cas()`,
   `OwnershipApplier`); records validated at ingest (round-2 L1); negative
   answers from memory; parity-tested against both substrates (§3.2).
10. **Unowned ⇒ machine-local-by-construction ⇒ admit — for `session-scoped`
   ONLY** (resolves M2; narrowed by round-3 C1) — no topic binding, no
   custody record, or a `released` record ADMIT for session-scoped writes;
   only a record positively naming another machine refuses. Session→topic
   comes from the in-memory topic-session binding
   (`TelegramAdapter.getTopicForSession`); a binding miss fails toward
   delivery (§3.2). The topic-scoped absent/released arm is decision 18.
11. **Admission is grounded on the FSM's single-owner guarantee** (resolves
   M5) — admit iff `ownerOf(scope) === thisMachine`, well-defined in
   `placing` and `transferring`; no F1 dependency; "contested" retired
   (there is no such FSM state).
12. **kv classification is exact-key; mixed-granularity keys are refused
   classification until split/re-keyed** (resolves OQ4) —
   `session-build-context` is re-keyed per machine as the first instance
   (resolves M3/M3-b), and every machine-local entry carries a named
   convergence story on both axes where a git-synced shared path is involved
   (I9, round-2 S1).
13. **Forward-on-refusal is the named follow-up `write-forward-on-refusal`,
   <!-- tracked: write-forward-on-refusal -->
   explicitly out of scope** (resolves OQ3) — its open sub-questions
   (idempotency set, whose authority the forward carries — KYP) transfer to
   that follow-up's own ceremony, not to this spec's builder.
   <!-- tracked: write-forward-on-refusal -->
14. **The wave-2 write-surface inventory is a build Phase-1 artifact and a
   `dryRun:false` ladder gate** (resolves OQ2; external finding #2) — the flip
   is refused while any mutating surface is absent from the registry (§3.5,
   §7).
15. **The admission check runs first in every mode; refusal authority arrives
   only at `dryRun:false`** (resolves OQ6) — no reorder event, no dry-mode
   behavior change, decision-log thinning only on actually-refused sends.
16. **Route-seam failure splits by domain; store seam falls back to legacy**
   (external finding #6) — machine-local proceeds (fail toward delivery),
   scoped/cluster-shared refuse typed `admission-error` (fail closed).
17. **Pool-dark collapses scoped domains to the legacy lease boolean**
   (resolves S5) — byte-identical to today's standby behavior; machine-local
   admits everywhere regardless.
18. **Topic-scoped absent/released ⇒ the legacy lease boolean, NOT admit**
   (resolves round-2 C1; folds external r2 #1) — the two scoped domains'
   absent arms diverge because their today-baselines diverge: session-scoped
   admit-on-absent is today-equivalent (the carve-out), topic-scoped
   admit-on-absent would be a LOOSENING (today every topic-keyed kv write
   refuses on every non-holder) and a dual-writer fork surface. Default:
   legacy boolean (I4 by construction). A registry entry may opt into
   admit-on-absent only by declaring an explicit absent-window convergence
   story, I9-audited on both axes (§3.2 decision table).
19. **The `releasedEvictionMs` eviction is a declared-but-unimplemented dead
   knob** (resolves round-2 S3) — no spec argument may cite it as an active
   mechanism; neither admission arm needs it (§3.2 released-arm grounding
   correction).

## 10. Open questions

**None.** Every round-1 open question (OQ1-OQ6) is resolved into the spec body
(§3.2, §3.3, §3.4, §3.5, §7) and summarized in §9; every round-2 finding is
resolved likewise (C1 → §3.2 decision table + §9.18; S1-S4, L1-L5 → §12). The
disposition trails are §11/§12 and the round reports
(`docs/specs/reports/standby-write-reconciliation-round{1,2}-findings.md`).

## 11. Round-1 findings disposition (revision history, round 2)

Round 1 reviewed the 8afd02e0a draft (report:
`docs/specs/reports/standby-write-reconciliation-round1-findings.md`; verdict
NOT CONVERGED — 5 MUST-FIX, 9 SHOULD-FIX, 6 LOW, incl. 7 dispositioned
external gemini findings). This round-2 revision folds ALL of them; zero
rejected; one external finding (#3, 503-vs-409) resolved differently than
proposed, with the rationale recorded in §9.1.

| finding | disposition | where |
|---|---|---|
| M1 (OQ1 load-bearing; I2 unsatisfiable vs the real store) | Adopted — ownership index decided: boot-warm `all()` + `onCommit` at the store funnel covering both mutation paths; `registry.read()` banned from the admission path | §3.2, §9.9, §8 parity/fs tests |
| M2 (unowned-session regression; reachability) | Adopted — unowned/unbound/released ⇒ machine-local-by-construction ⇒ admit; binding source named (in-memory topic-session registry); binding miss fails toward delivery | §3.2, I4-b, I5, §9.10 |
| M3 + M3-b (wrong kv key; shared git-synced file forks) | Adopted — exact key `session-build-context` corrected everywhere; store re-keyed `session-build-context-<machineId>` (machine-local, per-machine-path story); legacy key inert + lease-holder cleanup; generalized to I9 (no machine-local without a convergence story) | §1.1, §3.3, §3.1, I9, §9.12 |
| M4 (six open questions left to the builder) | Adopted — OQ2-OQ6 each resolved to a frontloaded decision; §10 emptied | §9.13-9.15, §9.1, §9.14, §10 |
| M5 (blanket fail-closed on `placing` + F1 dependency) | Adopted — admission grounded on the FSM single-owner guarantee (`ownerOf` well-defined in placing/transferring); no F1 dependency; "contested" retired | §3.2 rule 3, I5, §9.11 |
| S1 (evolution filename) | **Mis-diagnosed in round 1** — the round-1 finding itself was wrong (`addAction` writes `state/evolution/action-queue.json`; `evolution-queue.json` is the distinct proposals store). The round-2 fold faithfully applied the error; round 3 reverts it with the real call chain cited (round-2 S2) | §1.2, §12 |
| S2 (loop gauge = load oracle on unauth /health) | Adopted — gauge rides the AUTHED /health extension only (ropeHealth posture) | §6 |
| S3 (parent-doc paths don't resolve in-repo) | Adopted — qualified as agent-home session-A workspace docs | frontmatter `parent-spec` |
| S4 (guard-manifest entry implied, not deliverable) | Adopted — GUARD_MANIFEST entry named with key/kind/configPath/dryRunConfigPath/process/loadBearing | §3.5, §6 |
| S5 (pool-dark × writeAdmission-enabled unstated) | Adopted — scoped domains collapse to the legacy lease boolean; machine-local unaffected | §3.2, §5 row, §9.17 |
| S6 (P19 caller-retry brakes) | Adopted — `Retry-After` on every retryable refusal; no-busy-retry contract for internal callers; aggregate alert as tripwire | §3.4, §5 refusal-storm row |
| S7 (session- vs topic-scoped keying honesty) | Adopted — one topic-keyed index, two key derivations; session→topic source named; resolution is the caller's job | §3.1 keying note |
| L1 (Telegram abort precision) | Adopted — 15s (60s for long-poll getUpdates) | §1.3 |
| L2 (TOCTOU residual) | Adopted — accepted residual named with its convergence mechanism | §5 cross-machine-lag row |
| L3 (journal jail must survive fold-in) | Adopted — jail survives verbatim, stated + tested | §3.1, §3.6, §8 |
| L4 (refusal hint reads as instruction) | Adopted — hint is advisory prose, never a runnable command; consent-gating named | §3.4 |
| L5 (record :52 vs kv write :105 conflated) | Adopted — cites corrected | §1.1 |
| ext #1 (placing-stuck refusals) | Duplicate of M5 — folded there | §3.2, §9.11 |
| ext #2 (inventory before dryRun:false) | Adopted — ladder gate (a) on stage 2 | §3.5, §7 |
| ext #3 (503+Retry-After) | Contested-then-cleared — 409 kept uniformly, `Retry-After` adopted; 503 rejected as the feature-dark signature | §3.4, §9.1 |
| ext #4 (prefix matching too coarse) | Adopted — exact-key wave 1; mixed keys refused classification | §3.3, §9.12 |
| ext #5 (P1-A7 can block acceptance) | Adopted — starvation-window probes attributed + escalated + excluded; no-spike slow probe = real failure | §8 live-proof |
| ext #6 (route-seam throw fallback fail-open) | Adopted with per-domain split — machine-local proceeds; scoped/shared refuse `admission-error` | §3.4, §5, §9.16 |
| ext #7 (dryRun cost semantics) | Adopted — dryRun changes nothing in execution or spend; log-only | §7 |

## 12. Round-2 findings disposition (revision history, round 3)

Round 2 reviewed the 6beb99302 revision (report:
`docs/specs/reports/standby-write-reconciliation-round2-findings.md`; verdict
NOT CONVERGED — 1 MUST-FIX, 4 SHOULD-FIX, 5 LOW, incl. 2 dispositioned
external gemini findings). This round-3 revision folds ALL of them; zero
rejected.

| finding | disposition | where |
|---|---|---|
| C1 (topic-scoped absent⇒admit contradicts I4; folds external r2 #1) | Adopted — the scoped-domain rule is now ONE decision table split by domain: session-scoped absent/released ⇒ admit (today-equivalent, the M2 case); topic-scoped absent/released ⇒ the legacy lease boolean (byte-identical to today — I4 by construction), with an explicit I9-audited absent-window-story opt-in as the only exception. I4(b) restated per-domain against each domain's own today-baseline | §3.2 decision table, §3.1 table, §3.3, I4(b), I5, §5 new row, §8, §9.10, §9.18 |
| S1 (I9 conflates logical vs file-level convergence; wave-1 machine-local entries sit on git-synced shared paths) | Adopted — I9 gains a second axis (file-level arm `per-machine-path` \| `git-sync-excluded` required for any shared git-synced path); concrete wave-1 build item adds `.instar/state/attention-items.json` + `.instar/state/evolution/` to FileClassifier sync exclusions; WS2.5 story honesty stated (action-queue only; dark on fleet); `corrections` DROPPED from the table until it has a real story; "unrepresentable" softened to refusable+lint-checkable | §3.1 (table + two-axis paragraph), I9, §7 follow-ups <!-- tracked: topic-29836/close-the-loop-registrations -->, §8 |
| S2 (§1.2 store identification wrong — round-1 S1 was itself mis-diagnosed) | Adopted — `POST /evolution/actions` writes `state/evolution/action-queue.json` (`addAction` :1245 → `loadActions`/`saveActions` :1167/:1174 → `readFile`/`writeFile('action-queue')` :1168/:1201); the proposals store named as distinct; §11's round-1 S1 row re-marked mis-diagnosed; §8 probes pointed at the right file | §1.2, §11 S1 row |
| S3 (`releasedEvictionMs` cited as active but declared-and-unused) | Adopted — named a dead knob (do not re-cite); session-scoped released⇒admit re-grounded on today-equivalence alone; topic-scoped released⇒legacy-boolean needs no eviction argument | §3.2 released-arm grounding correction, §9.19 |
| S4 (`onCommit` must live at the store INTERFACE, not only LocalSessionOwnershipStore.persist) | Adopted — hook specified on the `SessionOwnershipStore` contract; each substrate fires at its mutation point (InMemory has no `persist()` funnel); the near-benign InMemory combination named as emergent, not a guarantee; parity test runs against BOTH substrates | §3.2 index point 2, §8, §9.9 |
| L1 (`all()` vs `loadOne()` validation asymmetry poisons the warm scan) | Adopted — index validates at ingest (string `ownerMachineId` + known status); malformed ⇒ fail-closed `ownership-unresolved` regardless of store path | §3.2 index point 4, I5, §8 |
| L2 (pre-construction window unstated) | Adopted — legacy blanket verdict until the one-way attach, which lands before routes are wired | §3.2 pre-construction window, §5 new row, §8 |
| L3 (re-key machine-id source + null fallback unnamed) | Adopted — coordinator/mesh identity (NOT the caller-less `StateManager.setMachineId`); fallback literal `local` on identity-less installs | §3.3 |
| L4 (admission-error should join the §6 aggregate; external r2 #2) | Adopted — named (route, code, direction) aggregate rows + the same deduped attention-item discipline, both fail directions | §6 |
| L5 (named follow-ups <!-- tracked: topic-29836/close-the-loop-registrations --> lack durable trackers) | Adopted — approval-time registration of the four named follow-ups <!-- tracked: topic-29836/close-the-loop-registrations --> as evolution actions/commitments; approval incomplete without them | §7 Close the Loop |
