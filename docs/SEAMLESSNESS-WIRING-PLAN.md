# Cross-Machine Seamlessness — Wiring Plan (crash-durable)

> Working roadmap for the FINAL integration stretch. Branch:
> `echo/cross-machine-seamlessness-spec` (worktree `.worktrees/seamlessness-spec`).
> Spec: `docs/specs/CROSS-MACHINE-SEAMLESSNESS-SPEC.md` (converged + approved).
> If you are a recovered session: READ THIS FIRST, then `git log --oneline JKHeadley/main..HEAD`.

## Context
- PR #419 already merged the engine PARTS to main (G1 lease, G3a ledger, live-tail
  buffer/redaction, adapter contract). That same branch was REUSED for the wire-layer
  follow-on, so it is now N commits ahead of main again and needs a **NEW PR** to land.
- All component classes exist and are unit-tested. The remaining work is INTEGRATION:
  bolting them into the live server startup + message loop, then the live 2-machine test.

## Component status
- WIRED in server.ts: FencedLease/LeaseCoordinator/GitLeaseStore/HttpLeaseTransport (G1),
  RegistrySyncDebouncer+wireRegistrySync (G2), live-tail RECEIVER (G3b/c standby side),
  HttpLiveTailTransport (sender constructed but NOT driven).
- NOT yet instantiated/wired: LiveTailSource (holder flush producer), HandoffWireTransport,
  HandoffReceiver, HandoffSentinel. Handoff ack/yield routes added to machineRoutes.ts but
  UNCOMMITTED + callbacks not supplied at the mount point (AgentServer.ts:338).

## Increments (commit + push each; trace+side-effects per src/ commit via /instar-dev)
- [x] **A** — ack/yield route HTTP surface, NOW LIVE: machineRoutes.ts routes + AgentServer
      `handoffWireTransport?` option + server.ts instantiation (gated lease block, 1:1 peer
      resolver) + integration tests (20/20) + e2e feature-is-alive proof (12/12). The routes
      are reachable+authenticated+delivering through the real booted server. recordAck/
      recordYield are safe no-ops until the orchestration (C) registers a handler.
- [x] **B** — holder-side LiveTailSource: ALREADY DONE (committed be65cb1ce, wired at
      server.ts:8146 — holder pushes the tail every liveTailPushRateMs when peers present).
- [ ] **C** — handoff orchestration: HandoffSentinel (outgoing: flush → awaitAck → verify →
      sendYield → demote) + HandoffReceiver (incoming: buildAck from buffer+ingress+threadHash;
      sendAck via transport; `onYield` registers receiver's acquireOnYield via leaseCoordinator
      consent path → transport.recordYield fires it) + `inProgress` race guard so
      reaper/scheduler don't act mid-handoff. This is what makes a real baton-pass run.
- [ ] **D** — verify G3a message-ledger gates the REAL Telegram ingress (exactly-once) +
      CONTINUATION resume on the receiving machine (no re-greet).
- [ ] **E** — integration + e2e + fault-injection tests for the wired path.
- [ ] **F** — build green + full battery + push + open NEW PR + CI green + merge to main.
- [ ] **G** — real two-machine over-Telegram test-as-self (laptop awake + mini standby):
      drive a live Telegram convo through a planned handoff AND a hard failover; verify from
      the user's chair: no lost msg, no dup reply, no re-greet, thread continuity.
- [ ] **H** — final report to Justin (topic 13481) + memory update + upgrade note.

## Hard rules in play
- instar-dev gate: every src/ commit needs trace (`skills/instar-dev/scripts/write-trace.mjs`)
  + side-effects artifact + `--spec docs/specs/CROSS-MACHINE-SEAMLESSNESS-SPEC.md`.
- Bob (port 4040) and Justin's real agents MUST stay untouched in the live test. Use a
  throwaway test mesh on non-default ports; clean up after.
- No context-death self-stops. Durable artifacts on disk = keep going.
